"Hi there, I'm soumya. I started my journey in tech in 2018 as a junior DevOps engineer. Since then, 
I've become skilled in various technologies like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, 
  AWS, and Azure cloud services.

In my current role, I handle nine projects on Kubernetes and 22 projects on ECS, along with managing virtual
machines for other projects. I'm experienced in setting up CI/CD pipelines and monitoring systems 
using tools like CloudWatch, Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus.

I'm excited about startups because of their innovative environment, and I'm eager to bring my skills to your team. 
Thank you for considering me."
